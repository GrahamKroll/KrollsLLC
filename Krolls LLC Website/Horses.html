            <h2>Testimony from current boarder</h2> <br>
            <p>“Boarding my two rescue horses with the Kroll family was the best experience I&#39sve had since I kept my horses on my own farm. They take excellent care of everyone&#39ss horses and pay attention to detail and go above and beyond to accommodate and to make your horse comfortable and safe. It is a beautiful location and their family are so wonderful to work with. I highly recommend this facility to anyone!” - Jess Snow</p> <br><br> 
            <p>"Found this gem of a spot out of pure luck! I wasn&#39st satisfied with the few previous places I&#39sve boarded. So I did a search in hopes of the perfect place for my sweet mare. Looking at the pictures simply do no justice of how beautiful, and peaceful the land is, access to the river is awesome. The owners have worked so hard into getting the acres set up for a comfortable home for horses! I&#39sm excited about the self watering system, and self care is great, I know my mare is in great hands!" - L. Davis</p><br><br> 
            <p>"This boarding place is by far the best. It&#39ss always a peaceful place to spend time with my horse; and I never have to worry because I know he is getting excellent care. Also there are many great trails nearby along the river. I love to be close to the Fairgrounds! My horse loves it here. The owner, Trisha and her family are very attentive. We highly recommend them. We love it here." - Adriano & Gabriele</p>
